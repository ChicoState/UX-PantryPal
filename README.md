# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Competitive analysis revealed that features across the competitors were all similar, but very **few offered cross platform access**, and many were for **specific device operating systems**
* Heuristic evaluation of a close competitor had a significant weaknesses in its complexity and error tolerance
* Users of this type of service will prefer something **streamlined and incredibly efficient** to use
* **Confirmation before actions that modify important data** will be important to users
* Development of personas and scenarios confirm the findings of analysis and evaluations.  Users want:
    * A simple and easy to use application
    * An application that is usable anywhere and any time
* The Sketches and Diagrams implement important features, like additional error tolerances and minimal buttons to contribute to a ***simplified UI***
